### 👩🏻‍💻 Hey! I'm Mimi. 

I'm looking for a new role in Applied ML - [contact me](mailto:mimireyburn@gmail.com) if you have any ideas for my next challenge!

Check out my [Obsidian notes on my projects](https://publish.obsidian.md/mimi/)!

At the same time, I'm working on some personal ML projects: 

- A local [recommendation engine](https://github.com/mimireyburn/Anchor) for articles and webpages with [Louis](https://github.com/lhorrell99).
- Creating [v2.0 of my Master's Project](https://github.com/myPocketKitchen/PK2.0) - a computer vision fridge to help reduce household food waste.
- A statistical investigation into where bias emerges in Stable Diffusion (public repo coming soon...) with [Amber](https://github.com/amberrignell).

Other projects are also documented here, including [Q-Learning](https://github.com/mimireyburn/MancalaBot) on the board game, Mancala, and an [LLM Weather](https://github.com/mimireyburn/LLMyWeather) widget. Take a look around ->
